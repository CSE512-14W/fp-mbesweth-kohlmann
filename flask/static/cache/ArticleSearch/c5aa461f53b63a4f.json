Glynn Ross, the general director of the Seattle Opera Association is speaking of operagoers, a breed known for their loyalty and passion. But even among such ardent devotees, the ones he is speaking about are a very special sort. They have come to Seattle from 25 different countries and from every state in the Union for a presentation of the complete Wagner ''Ring'' cycle in six days. In this new world outpost situated near mountains which once drew gold-seekers with as many dreams as those who yearn for the Rhine gold in Wagner's mythological realm, opera's grandest epic began last night with ''Das Rheingold'' and ends Thursday night with ''Gotterdammerung.'' Then, next Sunday, the cycle of four operas begins again in Andrew Porter's English translation.

Long, slow deliberations produced the decisions to strip the Rev. Charles E. Curran of Catholic University of his license to teach theology and to order Archbishop Raymond G.

Local chefs have such an enviable head start that one would think they couldn't miss. Well, some do, mostly by gilding the lilies with incongruous sauces and other embellishments. But when a chef hits the mark here, the results can be sublime. Below is a roundup of some Seattle area restaurants well worth visiting. All exude passionate dedication to regional ingredients like salmon, ling cod, Dungeness crab, spot prawns, Olympia oysters, venison and local mushrooms. Oriental influences are increasingly common, and rarely does one encounter cream-and-butter sauces in this health-conscious corner of the nation. Dahlia Lounge On fog-dampened week nights in autumn, downtown Seattle is not exactly a Mardi gras, yet the scene is always spirited at this stylish four-year-old establishment that serves bold (and occasionally bizarre) new American cuisine. The setting is provocative: soaring ceilings, vermilion walls, vintage neon, illuminated papier-mache fish and flower-patterned banquettes. For all the action in the dining room, it never gets distractingly loud. Dahlia Lounge is a husband-wife effort, with Tom Douglas running the kitchen and Jackie Cross tending to the guests. Mr. Douglas seems to be an inveterate experimenter. And just as many of Thomas Edison's early light bulbs probably shattered in his face, so do some of the chef's concoctions. Why, for example, would anyone take a classic pasta puttanesca, with garlic, olives and tomatoes, and lay over it big slices of rare-seared tuna? It's like adding wings to a Mercedes. A supposedly crisp-skinned garlic duck was not crispy, but rather covered with acrid burned garlic. Green bean risotto seemed like a fine idea, but it wasn't when the beans were served untrimmed and raw. Those exceptions aside, one can have a perfectly satisfying evening at Dahlia Lounge by cruising in the middle of the road with dishes like butternut squash soup; sauteed Alaskan spot prawns with Provencal herbs; grilled Alaska king salmon with ginger-sake butter, and grilled rosemary lamb chops with smoked-tomato ratatouille. Kaspar's In Seattle, the options for waterfront dining are diverse. One of the more imaginative spots is Kaspar's, a semicasual restaurant atop an office building overlooking the shipyards of Elliott Bay. Kaspar Donier, the chef-owner, is Swiss-born, but he wears his zeal for Northwest products on his sleeve. Nancy Donier, his wife, is a welcoming and earnest hostess. Mr. Donier offers two menus: one featuring his signature dishes, another with nightly specials. On a recent evening one special was exceptionally light ravioli filled with sweet rock prawns and spinach, all in a refreshingly light lemon sauce. His shellfish and wild rice chowder, from the regular menu, was creamy and delightfully briny, overflowing with mussels, scallops and clams. Firm, fresh gnocchi was the richest appetizer, as the dumplings were paired with artichoke hearts and napped in a rich, tasty Gruyere-flavored sauce. Only the Dungeness crab hash went unfinished for lack of seasoning. Three signature main courses are good bets: rare-cooked king salmon under a latticework of crunchy fried potatoes, braised lamb shank with garlic and rosemary sauce, and bouillabaisse built on a sturdy fish stock with the addition of lentils. Kaspar's has a good selection of Northwest wines at average prices. As for desserts, let the chef put together an assortment -- plum tart with cardamom-and-rum ice cream; pecan-and-sweet-potato pie with Grand Marnier cream, and ripe-fruit sorbets are among the choices. Wild Ginger If you want to know what East-meets-West cooking is all about, Wild Ginger is the place to find out. The creation of the young, soft-spoken owner, Rick Yoder, who spent several years in Southeast Asia filling his cognitive shopping cart with ideas, this is perhaps the most provocative, and fun, restaurant in Seattle. The big open dining room with cream-tinted walls, dramatic lighting and high-backed wooden booths is both casual and formal. A mahogany satay bar is a wonderful spot for a quick snack or multicourse tasting. All three satays sampled were arresting: pork basted with coconut milk and served with a complex hot sauce; large prawns in an Indonesian-style marinade of garlic, galangal (a type of ginger), chili and coconut, and a simple but delicious plate of grilled, garlic-infused Chinese eggplant. Choosing wines to match these exotic flavors is a challenge. High acid sauvignon blancs and chenin blancs work well, as do some beers. Main courses to try include sweet-hot black-pepper scallops with a soy and rice-wine dipping sauce; roasted duck seasoned with cinnamon and star anise and served with steamed buns that are used to make little sandwiches, and any of the noodle dishes. The steamed Chilean sea bass with shallot sauce, recommended by the waiter, lacked pizazz compared with the other dishes. Wild Ginger offers impressive daily vegetarian specials, something that is much in demand in this part of the country. Szmania's This smart-looking, friendly spot in the residential village of Magnolia, about 15 minutes from downtown Seattle, typifies the trend for top chefs to move from the city to outlying areas. The dining room is cheerful and bright, with lots of blond wood, colorful local art and a horseshoe-shaped dining bar. The strapping German-born chef and owner, Ludger Szmania (SMAHN-yah), was previously chef at the highly regarded Four Seasons Olympic Hotel. His menu defies description -- a little Pacific Northwest, a little Oriental, some German and Mexican thrown in for good measure. Yet his mastery of blending flavors is immediately evident. At lunch you can start with nicely browned Dungeness crab cakes with a roasted-pepper aioli, grilled Oriental chicken salad with a sprightly ginger-sesame dressing or a tortilla salad with spicy seafood and roasted peppers. Main courses include tasty smoked mozzarella ravioli in a simple but pleasing fresh tomato sauce or perfectly roasted monkfish under a lid of homemade potato chips with a light chanterelle cream sauce. The signature dessert is Magnolia dream cake, a stratified indulgence of peanut butter cream, chocolate cake and chocolate mousse. The Herbfarm What began as a backyard herb garden selling at a roadside stand in this gloriously rustic area about 30 minutes east of Seattle has evolved into a leafy wonderland and one of the best restaurants in the Pacific Northwest. It is also highly sought after, with an extremely restrictive reservations policy (see listing on page 6). The Herbfarm is open Friday, Saturday and Sunday only. A visit to The Herbfarm can be much more than an extraordinary meal. It also includes a tour of the magnificent, meticulously cultivated theme gardens -- 17 in all, covering 6 acres -- and kitchen garden. In addition, guests are given talks on the food's provenance and preparation by the owners and the chef during the nine-course tasting meal (there is only one menu, which changes weekly), and samplings of greenery that you never suspected were suitable for two-legged species. A recent dinner in the enchanting cottage that houses the restaurant, which seats only 32, started with a glass of dry 1988 Argyle Oregon Brut topped with sprigs of lemon verbena. \"You will notice that the herb gives the sparkling wine a wonderful aroma, but it does not affect the flavor at all,\" explained Ron Zimmerman, who owns the restaurant along with his wife, Carrie Van Dyck. The table was set with name cards atop mini-pumpkins, elegant silver and stemware and an arrangement of wildflowers and herbs. Each course is prepared in an open kitchen by the chef, Jerry Traunfeld, with detailed explanations of each ingredient. \"During the evening you will be served many strange and different flowers,\" he said. \"And all are edible unless we say otherwise.\" The first course was an aromatic tart of wild boletus mushrooms from southern Alaska, onions and marjoram, along with nasturtiums stuffed with nasturtium capers, and tiny Olympia oysters. From there it got exotic: a briny combination of Dungeness crab-and-fennel dumplings, Whidbey Island mussels, Pacific spot prawns and wild cauliflower mushrooms; little pumpkins containing pumpkin gnocchi with chanterelles and sage under shavings of a local sheep's-milk cheese, and herb-smoked wild king salmon (\"Line caught,\" Mr. Traunfeld assured us) with beet and arugula sauces. The show went on at a blissfully slow pace -- more than three hours -- as we reveled in herb-encrusted local lamb with a ginger and coriander sauce, a magnificent salad of wild greens and flowers, a splendid apple souffle and apple-caramel ice cream.Five Pacific Northwest wines accompanied the meal, which concluded with a vibrant 1927 Madeira. All of this luxury comes at a price: dinner came to $115 a person with wine; the six-course lunch is $50. page 6, sub head only SAMPLING A SPIRITED DINING SCENE Prices given below, with the exception of The Herbfarm, include a glass of house wine.

In late 1991, Nirvana's seminal grunge album \"Nevermind\" unexpectedly went platinum, and the airwaves were suddenly filled with the guitar-heavy sounds of Pearl Jam, Alice in Chains and Screaming Trees. A feeding frenzy ensued: reporters swarmed into the Northwest, looking for clues to the \"Seattle sound\"; for a while, it seemed as if anyone with a loud guitar and a flannel shirt could land a record deal. Of course, this wasn't the first time the industry had fixated on a single city. In the late 60's all ears were on San Francisco's psychedelic groups; a decade later, the minimalist, punk-inspired bands of the East Village in New York drew national attention. In the 80's, the pace of discovery reached breakneck speed: Minneapolis, then Athens, Ga., then Austin, Tex., then Chapel Hill, N.C. But Seattle marked the most successful -- or at least the most profitable -- attempt to define a musical moment in a single city. The birth of a fledgling music community is a process rich with old-fashioned values like hard work and cooperation. But these days, the industry isn't content to let small-town stars remain on the hey-let's-put-on-a-show scale for long. From Boise, Idaho, to Santa Barbara, Calif., kids with nothing but an electric guitar and a dream go to bed one night in blessed obscurity, and wake up the next morning in the hippest place in America, their every step tracked by fashion designers trying to cop their style, music critics desperate to name their sound and record-label reps waving contracts. The only consolation is that the attention doesn't last long: In July, Entertainment Weekly labeled San Diego the nation's \"Cool Music Scene\"; a month later, Billboard dubbed Chicago \"the new capital of the cutting edge\"; and finally, in October, Time handed the crown to . . .

From July through September -- the dry months in this notoriously wet city -- Seattle hums with a manic energy as residents try to shoehorn as much outdoor fun as possible into those precious, long-lingering summer days.

From my window, on the 10th floor of the \u00c4ndra, the Westin (a pair of round skyscrapers) dominates the skyline. For those who want to avoid large convention hotels, boutique-style offerings include a handsome W and the Monaco (part of the Kimpton chain of quirky small hotels). The \u00c4ndra, which opened in April 2004, is less chic than the W, less offbeat than the Monaco and less expensive than either. The Rooms -- In a city where Rem Koolhaas's Seattle Public Library has raised the architectural bar, the kind of earth-tone-modern look that the \u00c4ndra goes for (beige walls, wenge-wood furniture and charcoal-colored bedspreads) seems almost pass\u00e9. There are several nice touches, however. A Tivoli clock radio -- a device with a retro look but high-tech guts -- provides a terrific sound. And there's a coffee maker -- practically unheard of in a hotel that also offers room service breakfast. I stowed a container of milk in my minibar refrigerator the night before, and I was good to go. But the reading lamps are angled incorrectly and have blue-glass shades, which cast a peculiar light. The TV is huge, and dominates the dresser. Windows open from the bottom (which is only about 20 inches off the floor), and there are no child guards -- which, even if legal, seems unwise. The entire hotel is nonsmoking. The Bathroom -- Like the bedroom, it feels like an old room that's been modernized, but inconsistently. (The sink, for some reason, is an imitation Victorian pedestal model.) Happily, the toilet is a Flushometer, the tankless type that ''whooshes'' -- and is practically impossible to clog. But whoever had the idea of shrink-wrapping individual bars of soap (the case in more and more hotels) needs a new job; I had to leave the bathroom and use the knife from a room service tray to unwrap the small bar (made by Face Stockholm). There were also a couple of (minor) housekeeping glitches. The Location -- Fourth Avenue is a prime Seattle address. Rem Koolhaas's library is on Fourth, as are the Monaco and W hotels (in the heart of downtown). The \u00c4ndra is at the north end of downtown, at the beginning of Belltown, a neighborhood distinguished by one thing: the presence of a red banner on every lamppost that says ''Belltown''. The attractions of the Seattle Center -- including the Space Needle and the Seattle Repertory Theater -- are nearby. So are some of the city's best restaurants, including the dazzling Lampreia. Amenities -- The health club is literally a hotel room (No. 309), with three machines and a single bench for lifting. But there's also an arrangement with a nearby sports club. Day passes are available at the hotel for $12. The hotel's restaurant, Lola, serves a smart array of Greek-inspired food (like kebab of squid, crushed chili and chermoula, a Moroccan marinade). Mobbed on a Friday night, it is one of four popular Seattle outposts of the star chef Tom Douglas. Most annoying amenity: TV's, which were tuned to CNBC, in the elevators. Room service -- Pretty much the Lola menu. At bedtime, a pie of goat's milk custard with orange caramel sauce and sour cherries ($8) was unusual and delicious. The next morning, breakfast, ordered at 9:05, arrived at 9:20. The Greek yogurt with granola and fresh fruit ($10) was the Platonic ideal of a healthy breakfast. Order toast ($5), without specifying a type, and you get crunchy, delicious sourdough, straight from Tom Douglas's bakery across the street. The Bottom Line -- A standard room is $189. In a city with lots of hotels, the \u00c4ndra adds an enjoyable, medium-price option. Hotel \u00c4ndra is at 2000 Fourth Avenue; (877) 448-8600; www.hotelandra.com. FRED A.

Turner watercolor described as the culmination of his achievement in the medium could fetch more than $3.5 million when it goes to auction at Christie's in London on June 5, the BBC reported.

The record for a British artwork on paper was set in June 2000, when Dante Gabriel Rossetti's ''Pandora'' was sold for $4.59 million, and the record for a work on paper by Turner was set in 2001 when ''Heidelberg, With a Rainbow'' went for $3.55 million.

Clouds lift, mountains and water come out of hiding, decks fill with flowers and bare limbs, and trendy menus promote a different local berry every week: strawberries, raspberries, marionberries. At noon, the light is so dazzling that the city almost looks like Provence: an illusion enhanced by the masses of lavender at farmers' markets and the wonderful French restaurants popping up around town. At dusk, which lingers past 9 o'clock, a silvery Alpine wash suffuses the snowcap of Mount Rainier. Seattlites take to the hills and islands on weekends, freeing parking spots and restaurant tables for visitors downtown and in the nice old residential neighborhoods that are adjacent. No need to gnash your teeth in envy as software magnates wave from yachts and sailboats. For a $6.50 round trip you can hop a commuter ferry from downtown to Bainbridge Island and bask in the same spectacular view. DAVID LASKIN Friday 4 p.m. 1 -- Microbrew, but Macroview Before hitting the water, admire it with cold drink in hand from a strategic vantage point on land. In Pike Place Market -- downtown's historic water-view bazaar -- the Pink Door (1919 Post Alley, 206-443-3241) boasts the deck of decks. Grab a locally brewed Maritime Imperial I.P.A. or a Willamette Valley pinot noir and sit back and enjoy the show. If hunger strikes, assorted bruschetta, including an inventive spring pea, mint and bresaola combo ($12.50), should tide you over. 5 p.m. 2 -- Northwest Showcases The food stalls will be closing, but you can wander through some of the galleries scattered around the market: Lisa Harris Gallery (1922 Pike Place, 206-443-3315; www.lisaharrisgallery.com) offers Northwest painting, photography and sculpture; Art Stall Gallery (97 Pike Place, 206-623-7538; www.artstallgallery.com) features the work of 13 Northwest artists; and Raven's Nest Treasure (85-B Pike Street, 206-343-0890; www.ravensnesttreasure.com) carries art, crafts and jewelry by American Indians from the Northwest and Alaska. 7:30 p.m. 3 -- Fall Hard Forget spontaneity and call a week or two ahead to secure a table at Crush (2319 East Madison Street, 206-302-7874), the hot restaurant du jour that's tucked away in a funky old house on an otherwise dreary stretch of Madison Street. From the chilled sweet pea, cucumber and lovage soup ($8) to the melt-in-your-mouth braised short ribs ($21) to the buttermilk doughnuts with espresso sauce ($7), all is exquisite, subtle, creative, but not pretentious -- and (aside from the wine) not that expensive. Beautiful food, beautiful people, beautifully stark d\u00e9cor of sea foam walls and bone leather banquettes, Crush is hard to get into and hard to leave. 10 p.m. 4 -- O Pioneers! Urban pioneers staked out Belltown, the blocks along First and Second Avenues just north of Pike Place Market between Virginia and Wall Streets, about 15 years ago. Restaurants, bars and condos followed, and now it's the only downtown neighborhood with savory after-dark street life. Drop by the venerable -- by Belltown standards -- Queen City Grill (2201 First Avenue, 206-443-0975) for a nightcap under the soft apricot glow of the bar lights. If the Queen is somnolent, hike a couple of blocks to join the young and lively at the Black Bottle (2600 First Avenue at Vine Street, 206-441-1500) for fresh sardines namban and a glass of Waterbrook sauvignon blanc made in Walla Walla. Saturday 9 a.m. 5 -- Sighing in the Chapel Nobody walks more than three blocks in Seattle, except to air the dog or power around Green Lake. But that's no reason to pass up a 15-minute stroll from Espresso Vivace Roasteria (901 East Denny Way at Broadway, 206-860-5869) on Capitol Hill to the campus of Seattle University at the south end of the hill. (You'll probably wait long enough at Espresso Vivace to hear the life stories of the people next to you in line, but it's worth it for the artfully foamed latte and cappuccino.) By now, you may be inclined to agree with the urban connoisseurs who sniff that Seattle has scenery but no architecture. But don't rush to judgment until you have spent time at the Chapel of St. Ignatius, designed by Steven Holl and opened in 1997, on the east side of the university's campus (East Marion Street and 12th Avenue). Mr. Holl said the soaring, austerely luminous space was supposed to look like ''seven bottles of light in a stone box.'' The campus grounds, lovingly tended for years by a local garden guru, Ciscoe Morris, are filled with mature Japanese maples, hydrangeas and a superb weeping giant sequoia. Noon 6 -- Sip, Nibble, Paddle Don't be put off by the cafeteria-style service of Agua Verde Cafe & Paddle Club (1301 Northeast Boat Street, 206-545-8570) on Portage Bay at the edge of the University District (five minutes by car from downtown or Capitol Hill). The tacos -- smoked salmon, shrimp and cabbage; yams with chilies and avocados -- are divine ($8.95 for three tacos with beans and rice), and the margaritas aren't bad either. But don't have too many. After lunch, you'll want to be in shape to rent a kayak ($18 an hour for a double) and ply the calm waters of the Lake Washington Ship Canal, the wetlands surrounding the Arboretum or the houseboat-lined margins of Lake Union. 4 p.m. 7 -- Of Fuchsias and Salmon If you prefer to keep your toes dry, you can watch weekend speedboat warriors rub prows with Alaska-bound fishermen at the Hiram M. Chittenden Locks (on the Ship Canal at 3015 Northwest 54th Street at the south end of the Ballard neighborhood west of the University District). The surrounding botanical garden has huge shade trees and a glorious bed of fuchsias. Be sure to cross the canal on the pedestrian bridge to the fish ladder viewing area to gape at mature returning salmon struggling upstream. 8 p.m. 8 -- Rustic French If you're staying downtown and you're tired of zipping around the neighborhoods, you can't go wrong by dining at the old standby Cafe Campagne (1600 Post Alley in Pike Place Market, 206-728-2233) for classic French bistro fare. The more energetic should pile back into the car and drive 10 minutes east of downtown to the French newcomer Cr\u00e9mant (1423 34th Avenue, 206-322-4600) in the pretty Madrona neighborhood beside Lake Washington. Work up an appetite by cruising Lake Washington Boulevard, a leafy waterside motorway designed by the Olmsted Brothers in 1903 as part of an urban master plan. Now you can enjoy Cr\u00e9mant's hearty rustic fare of mouth-watering roasted marrow bones served with grilled bread ($12), Roquefort and endive salad ($12) and rosemary-infused c\u00f4te d'agneau ($22). 10:30 p.m. 9 -- Funeral Parlor Chic A former funeral parlor may not sound like a promising place to kick back to D.J.-spun tunes of danceable Brazilian, techno and hip-hop and enjoy fancy drinks like cantaloupe-infused vodka or a ginger Cosmopolitan (vodka, triple sec, ginger and cranberry), but the Chapel (1600 Melrose Avenue on Capitol Hill, 206-447-4180) manages to be chic, young, foxy and fun. Ask the tender of the imposing bar made of mausoleum stones about the ghost sightings and be sure to check out the sinks in the disco-theme unisex bathrooms. Sunday 10 a.m. 10 -- Penance and Hash Blond wood, high bright windows, a cheery outside deck, big bowls of fresh fruit, yogurt and granola: Portage Bay Caf\u00e9 (4130 Roosevelt Way NE, 206-547-8230) is the perfect place to do penance for sins committed at the Chapel. You can also keep on sinning with Swedish pancakes with lingonberry compote ($9.95) or corned beef hash topped with three scrambled eggs ($11.95). Work off the vapors with a brisk walk along the nearby Burke-Gilman Trail, a 12.5-mile paved biking-walking path that snakes through the city. 11 a.m. 11 -- Goodbye, With Altitude Say farewell to Seattle atop the squat water tower built in the first decade of the 1900's that rises above the lawns, fountains, museum and conservatory of Volunteer Park on Capitol Hill. On a clear day you can snap your final photo of the Space Needle as the Olympic Mountains loom behind. THE BASICS And the Coffee Isn't Bad, Either If you want the flexibility to hop from downtown to surrounding neighborhoods, it's best to rent a car at SeaTac Airport, about a 20-minute drive from downtown. The Alexis Hotel (1007 First Avenue, 206-624-4844; www.alexishotel.com) is a nice downtown boutique hotel -- soft colors, subdued lighting, attentive service and spacious rooms (though few have views and some face walls). Weekend rates are $319 to $449. The dowdy Vance Hotel metamorphosed last October into Hotel Max (620 Stewart Street, 206-728-6299; www.hotelmaxseattle.com) and is now among the toniest places in town, with eye-popping contemporary art (lots of nudes) in the lobby and WiFi and flat-screen TV's in the sleek bedrooms. Weekend rates start at $159. The Watertown Hotel, in the University District, (4242 Roosevelt Way NE, 206- 826-4242; www.watertownseattle.com) offers a clean, bright alternative to downtown. Weekend rates for double rooms are $155 to $185, including breakfast.", "headline": {"main": "Seattle", "kicker": "36 HOURS"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "3", "word_count": 1520, "_id": "4fd278f38eb7c8105d83ba0b", "snippet": "It\u2019s summer in Seattle, and the living is easier.

When you consider that Merce Cunningham, Robert Joffrey and Mark Morris were also born here, and first studied dance here, you can't help wondering if some dance-friendly ingredient flows in the air. You wonder the same again when you recall that Seattle's Pacific Northwest Ballet has been among America's foremost ballet companies since the 1980s, reaching international stature in the 1990s. Until this month these and other Northwestern dance strands felt unconnected, and a local complaint about Pacific Northwest Ballet has been that it isn't Northwestern enough. Now, however, Peter Boal, its artistic director since 2005, has made more local connections than one would have imagined possible, in a ''Celebrate Seattle!'' festival, from April 17 to 22. His company danced works by Mr. Cunningham, Joffrey, Ms. Brown and Mr. Morris; the Cunningham and Morris works drew on local inspiration (with music by John Cage and Lou Harrison, respectively). It also danced works by Kent Stowell and his son Christopher, played host to other local dance companies and presented world premieres by its own choreographers.

''Anyone traveling by air today knows that aviation is already stretched to the breaking point,'' said Greg Principato, president of the council. In a statement, the group said that ''2007 is stacking up to be similar to and in some instances worse than 2000, a year which until now had the dubious distinction of being the peak year for air-travel delays.'' Most airport improvement projects -- for runways, terminals, gates and the like -- are paid for by the so-called passenger facility charge added to the price of airline tickets. That charge has been capped by Congress at $4.50 since 2000, but the council said Congress should increase the cap. MIAMI NO. 1 IN ROAD RAGE -- In a survey rating discourteous driving in American cities, Miami was named the worst, followed by New York, Boston, Los Angeles and Washington, according to AutoVantage, an automobile club. The most-courteous cities or city-pairs were Portland, Ore., followed by Pittsburgh, Seattle/Tacoma, St. Louis and Dallas/Fort Worth. For the survey -- conducted by Prince Market Research in 25 metropolitan areas -- more than 2,500 drivers were interviewed by telephone. Road rage was defined in various categories like ''bad, rude, careless driving, such as cutting others off, talking on the cellphone, speeding, or going too slow in the fast lane.''

But at some point, as they found themselves up in a stand of fir trees with a majestic view of Mount Rainier, their perspective shifted. What began as a 12-by-12-foot platform grew into a virtual treehouse complex: hot tub, living room (with phone, cable, Internet), writing alcove, observation platforms. Despite its inviting suspension bridge and 100-foot zipline, this is no kids' tree fort. A typical evening among the gently swaying firs involves several grown-ups, a dip in the hot tub, Champagne and a few rounds of canasta. ''It's a way to be in nature,'' Shara Di Valerio said. She let out a deflating laugh and quickly added: ''Although it's a luxurious kind of nature. It isn't camping.'' The luxury treehouse is a relatively recent phenomenon. Twenty years ago, there was no such thing as a ''master treehouse builder.'' There is now. Thanks to a confluence of eco-conscious clients looking for sustainable hideaways and recent technological advances that allow elaborate structures to be hung higher and more safely than ever, this may be the golden age of the treehouse. There are now more than 10 dedicated builders of adult tree dwellings in the United States. But if any single person is responsible for the treehouse renaissance, it is Peter Nelson. In 1997, he and a partner founded TreeHouse Workshop, a Seattle firm that built a dozen treehouses last year (including the Di Valerios').

The killer had a consistent modus operandi: he would rape the women, strangle them with his hands or a ligature, and then discard their bodies near the Green River. The police compiled a short list of suspects, including Gary Ridgway, a factory worker. But DNA testing was still in its infancy in the 1990s, and since officers lacked enough physical evidence to tie Mr. Ridgway to the crimes, they were unable to arrest him. ''The case had basically come to a standstill,'' said Beverly Himick, a forensic scientist at the Washington State Patrol Crime Laboratory. In 2001, a one-two technological punch brought the case back to life. Forensic investigators decided to re-examine evidence compiled years before with the help of two new modes of DNA analysis: the polymerase chain reaction (P.C.R.) test and the short tandem repeat (S.T.R.) test. Together, these tests proved indispensable because they allowed the scientists to sequence and copy very short fragments of DNA taken from crime scenes. ''It was a last-ditch effort,'' Dr. Himick said. ''We didn't have a lot to work with, but we went through a lot of evidence again. We rinsed all the fingernails to look for trace evidence and swabbed the ligatures for cellular material.
