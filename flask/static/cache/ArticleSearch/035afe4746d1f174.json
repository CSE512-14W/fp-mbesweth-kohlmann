Mr. Osborne's play, exported from London to New York in 1958, was more than a vehicle that helped Laurence Olivier descend from a classical pinnacle and deliver the tawdry puns of Archie Rice, the script's rueful, leering and grinning ne'er-do-well. ''The Entertainer'' was, and remains, a gargoyle of an evening.

The well-being of public art in American cities has been ignored and neglected for too long. The Parks Department and the Central Park Conservancy have struggled to maintain the city's public statuary with limited budgets and private funds. The pollution and vandalism of urban environments are hostile to works of art in stone and bronze. Nineteenth-century stone sculptures displayed outdoors are in such bad condition that many have suffered irreparable damage. Though there are several ways to clean and preserve bronze in outdoor settings, no single one is considered both safe and suitable. The cardinal rule in conservation is reversibility (that is, that any treatment undertaken on a work of art can be undone, leaving no effect).

In 1948, Life magazine featured Madison as its pick for the best place to live in America; thankfully, not much has changed. It's the kind of place where you will find well-maintained (and well-used) bike paths, an abundance of locally grown organic food at the weekend farmers' market and bed-and-breakfasts with ecological and historical awareness.

Strolling the avenue is an ideal way to get the lay of the land and an idea of how eclectic this town really is: you will see the progression of businesses from crunchy coffee bars, record shops and thrift stores to upscale bars, restaurants and brew pubs. The bars get busy on football weekends. And the campus stadium is filled with fans who come back weekend after weekend to cheer the Badgers. Start your journey off right with some of the richest ice cream you will ever have -- made by the university's dairy students from the agriculture school -- at the Memorial Union (800 Langdon Street, 608-265-3000).

It is also a carefully contrived stunt, with the dogs propped up on stools as hidden actors hold them in place. These actors also provide the dogs with surrogate hands with which to hold food, books and other items.
