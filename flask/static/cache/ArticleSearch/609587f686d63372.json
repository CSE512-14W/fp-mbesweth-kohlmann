What's between the lines in those cables, though, is another matter. It is a rather sobering message. America is leaking power. Let's start, though, with what's in the cables. I think I've figured it out: Saudi Arabia and its Arab neighbors want the U.S. to decapitate the Iranian regime and destroy its nuclear facilities so they can celebrate in private this triumph over the hated Persians, while publicly joining with their people in the streets in burning Uncle Sam in effigy, after we carry out such an attack on Iran -- which will make the Arab people furious at us. The reason the Arab people will be furious at us, even though many of them don't like the Persians either, is because they dislike their own unelected leaders even more and protesting against the Americans, who help to keep their leaders in power, is a way of sticking it to both of us.", "headline": {"main": "The Big American Leak", "kicker": "OP-ED COLUMNIST"}, "abstract": "Thomas L Friedman Op-Ed column asserts that the WikiLeaks cables show that America is losing its dominance on the world stage (M)", "print_page": "8", "word_count": 907, "_id": "4fd29d7b8eb7c8105d87fb72", "snippet": "There is a sobering message somewhere between the lines of those WikiLeaks cables: America is leaking power.", "source": "The New York Times", "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/05/opinion/05friedman.html", "multimedia": [{"url": "images/2010/09/16/opinion/Friedman_New/Friedman_New-thumbStandard.jpg", "subtype": "thumbnail", "legacy": {"hasthumbnail": "Y", "thumbnailheight": 75, "thumbnail": "images/2010/09/16/opinion/Friedman_New/Friedman_New-thumbStandard.jpg"}, "type": "image", "height": 75}], "subsection_name": null, "keywords": [{"name": "glocations", "value": "IRAN"}, {"name": "glocations", "value": "NORTH KOREA"}, {"name": "glocations", "value": "CHINA"}, {"name": "glocations", "value": "UNITED STATES"}, {"name": "glocations", "value": "SAUDI ARABIA"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "STATE DEPARTMENT"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "WIKILEAKS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "UNITED STATES INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "UNITED STATES ECONOMY"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "CLASSIFIED INFORMATION AND STATE SECRETS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "DIPLOMATIC SERVICE, EMBASSIES AND CONSULATES"}], "byline": {"person": [{"firstname": "Thomas", "middlename": "L.", "lastname": "FRIEDMAN", "rank": 1, "role": "reported", "organization": ""}], "original": "By THOMAS L.

Either way, the release of formerly classified documents and diplomatic cables over the last six months have helped transform the site and its founder, Julian Assange, into known entities. But while thinking of Apple or Facebook or even the 2008 Obama campaign calls up certain aesthetic associations or shorthand imagery, WikiLeaks mostly brings to mind the image of Assange's wan face and silver hair. Perhaps, as Daniel van der Velden of the design studio Metahaven argues, WikiLeaks ought to re-evaluate its ''visual identity.'' ''Does it matter what it looks like?'' he asked in a talk sponsored by the Graphic Design Museum in the Netherlands. ''Maybe it does.'' To pursue this reasoning, I recently spoke with van der Velden and his Metahaven partner and co-founder, Vinca Kruk. They argue that WikiLeaks's evolving public role means that it now operates in a different ''image economy.'' That phrase, van der Velden explained, refers to ''the set of images and faces, visual impressions, that surround the organization and the values that these stand for.'' A Google image search for WikiLeaks, for instance, now calls up not just its logo and pictures of Assange but also images of war, famous politicians, prominent supporters and opponents.
